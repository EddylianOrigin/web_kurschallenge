/**
 * You can search for whitespace using \s, which is a lowercase s. This pattern not only matches whitespace, but also carriage return, tab, form feed, and new line characters. You can think of it as similar to the character class [ \r\t\f\n\v].

 let whiteSpace = "Whitespace. Whitespace everywhere!"
 let spaceRegex = /\s/g;
 whiteSpace.match(spaceRegex);

 This match call would return [" ", " "].

 Change the regex countWhiteSpace to look for multiple whitespace characters in a string.
